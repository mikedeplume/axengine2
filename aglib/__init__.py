__doc__ = """A data-driven game engine in development which simplifies managing
    a game's many different types of objects. It aims to provide a simple,
    powerful, cross-platform compatible, framework and data scheme for
    building, debugging, and maintaining a game.

    Ultimately it will respond to various aspects of a game based on the
    current files in a specific directory, or some similar means of allowing
    real-time development of a game by using your operating system and a text
    editor (or a frontend to this method in another programming language.)."""
